# TF Kubernetes GreenOps Module

A comprehensive Terraform module for deploying a complete environmental impact monitoring and cost tracking stack on Kubernetes clusters. This module orchestrates six specialized sub-modules to provide visibility into your cluster's energy consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact.

## Overview

The GreenOps Module provides a unified way to deploy and manage:

- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and storage with `kube-prometheus-stack`
- **KEDA** - Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling with optional example deployments
- **OpenCost** - Cost monitoring and allocation with carbon cost tracking
- **Kepler** - Environmental impact tracking via the Kepler Operator with optional power monitoring
- **Scaphandre** - Container-level power consumption monitoring
- **KubeGreen** - Automated resource cleanup and pod hibernation for cost optimization

All components are **enabled by default** and can be selectively disabled based on your requirements.

## Features

- 🟢 **Modular Architecture** - Deploy only the components you need
- 🔧 **Flexible Configuration** - HCL-based values configuration with sensible defaults
- 🔄 **Dynamic Git References** - Support for branches, tags, and commits
- 📊 **Integrated Monitoring** - Pre-configured metric scraping and alerting
- 💰 **Cost Visibility** - Track Kubernetes resource costs and carbon footprint
- 🚀 **Production Ready** - Enterprise-grade deployments with proper namespacing

## Quick Start

### Basic Deployment

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

All six components (Prometheus, KEDA, OpenCost, Kepler, Scaphandre, and KubeGreen) are enabled by default.

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Module Details

### Prometheus
Monitoring and metrics collection powered by `kube-prometheus-stack`. Includes Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager. Essential foundation for the entire monitoring stack.

**Use case**: When you need comprehensive cluster metrics, visualization, and alerting capabilities.

### KEDA
Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling enables scaling based on events and external metrics, not just CPU/memory. Includes optional example deployments.

**Use case**: When you need to autoscale workloads based on event sources (queues, schedules, metrics) or custom metrics.

### OpenCost
Cloud cost monitoring and allocation with carbon footprint tracking. Integrates with Prometheus for cost visibility.

**Use case**: When you need to track infrastructure costs and carbon emissions by workload, namespace, or pod.

### Kepler
Kubernetes Environmental Power Profiling Operator tracks environmental impact and power consumption. Includes optional PowerMonitor resource for detailed power metrics.

**Use case**: When you want to monitor and optimize the energy efficiency and environmental impact of your Kubernetes cluster.

### Scaphandre
Container-level power consumption monitoring using CPU models and turbostat. Provides granular power usage data.

**Use case**: When you need detailed power consumption data at the container or process level.

### KubeGreen
Automated resource cleanup and pod hibernation for cost optimization. Automatically sleeps and wakes workloads on schedules.

**Use case**: When you want to reduce costs by automatically sleeping non-production workloads during off-hours.
